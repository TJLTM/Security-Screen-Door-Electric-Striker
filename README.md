# Security-Screen-Door-Electric-Striker
no electric outdoor striker exists for my application

standard metal security screen doors don't have a drop in electric striker that can be used to buzz people in. I'm installing a Unifi Door Hub Mini to pair with my G4 Doorbell Pro and the requirements i have for this is that the normal door be able to be able to be "buzzed" in while the deadbolt will be normal and block this functionality. The steel door jam tube is 1.25x1.25x(1/64) (in) square tube which is a mostly hard requirement for size because of installation. This design is going to be machined out of a 1.25x1.25 inch hot roll bar billet. same for the striker drop. this is a fail secure design if you want a fail safe design.... then ya'll can figure it out or ask me to make one.
